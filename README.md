# Repository Manager

A VS Code extension for Git workflows across a parent repository and its linked repositories (Git submodules), from one dashboard.

## Features

- **Overview:** every repository in one dashboard, with drift from the target branch, a commit graph, changed files and diffs. Compare any two commits or branches, and filter or search history.
- **Branches across repositories:** create, switch and delete branches in the repositories you pick, with naming rules for `main`, `dev`, `feature`, `task` and `release`.
- **Uncommitted changes:** each repository's history starts with your local changes and their staged and unstaged diffs, kept current as you edit.
- **Everyday Git:** checkout, fetch, pull, push, open a pull request, rebase, reset or drop commits (with a backup branch), and align linked repositories to their recorded commits.
- **AI review with Copilot:**
  - **Review changes** (your uncommitted work, before you commit), **Review commit**, **Review branch** (the files changed since the default branch, or every file from its **▾** menu);
  - findings cite exact lines and can be triaged; Copilot explains any of them (cause, risk, fix, how to confirm it) and fixes the ones you mark;
  - **Write with Copilot** drafts a commit message that follows the repository's commit convention (or Conventional Commits);
  - results open in their own **Repository Review** tab, and a review keeps running when you close it;
  - stopped reviews continue where they left off, and past reviews are saved;
  - review skills (security checklists by file type) turn on automatically, and **Clean code** adds maintainability notes that never block.

  Results are advisory. See [docs/security-compliance-review-engine.md](docs/security-compliance-review-engine.md) for how a review works.

## Install

Download the `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eurus-labs/Repository-Manager/releases). In VS Code, open Extensions, choose **… › Install from VSIX…**, and select the file.

## Use

Open it from the Activity Bar icon, the command **Repository Manager: Open Repository Manager**, or `Ctrl+Shift+G M` (`Cmd+Shift+G M` on macOS). `Ctrl+Shift+G R` refreshes the repository list.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `repositoryManager.defaultBranch` | `main` | Default branch for branch workflows |
| `repositoryManager.autoFetch` | `true` | Fetch in the background while the dashboard is visible; never prunes and never prompts for credentials |
| `repositoryManager.autoFetchInterval` | `5` | Minutes between background fetches |
| `repositoryManager.copilot.askBeforeSending` | `never` | When to ask before code is sent to Copilot (reviews, fixes, explanations, summaries, commit messages): `never`, `oncePerRepository` or `always`; also in the ⚙ menu next to **Model** |
| `repositoryManager.showNotifications` | `true` | Show notifications for Git operations |
| `repositoryManager.githubToken` | `""` | Optional GitHub token for pull request operations |

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74 or newer and Git 2.20 or newer.
- AI summaries, reviews and fixes need VS Code 1.91 or newer and GitHub Copilot.

```bash
npm ci
npm test          # compile, lint and test suites
